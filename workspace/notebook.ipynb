It has continued to serve customers through dramatic changes in Europe, such as the Holy Roman Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and both world wars. What characteristics enable a business to stand the test of time?\n\nTo help answer this question, BusinessFinancing.co.uk researched the oldest company still in business in **almost** every country and compiled the results into several CSV files. This dataset has been cleaned.\n\nHaving useful information in different files is a common problem. While it's better to keep different types of data separate for data storage, you'll want all the data in one place for analysis. You'll use joining and data manipulation to work with this data and better understand the world's oldest businesses.\n\n## The Data\n`data/businesses.csv` and `data/new_businesses.csv`\n|Column|Description|\n|------|-----------|\n|`business`|Name of the business (varchar)|\n|`year_founded`|Year the business was founded (int)|\n|`category_code`|Code for the business category (varchar)|\n|`country_code`|ISO 3166-1 three-letter country code (char)|\n\n`data/countries.csv`\n|Column|Description|\n|------|-----------|\n|`country_code`|ISO 3166-1 three-letter country code (varchar)|\n|`country`|Name of the country (varchar)|\n|`continent`|Name of the continent the country exists in (varchar)|\n\n`data/categories.csv`\n|Column|Description|\n|------|-----------|\n|`category_code`|Code for the business category (varchar)|\n|`category`|Description of the business category (varchar)|","metadata":{},"id":"3093f28a-1efc-4811-899f-278d698bd09b","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\nbusinesses = pd.read_csv(\"data/businesses.csv\")\nnew_businesses = pd.read_csv(\"data/new_businesses.csv\")\ncountries = pd.read_csv(\"data/countries.csv\")\ncategories = pd.read_csv(\"data/categories.csv\")","metadata":{"executionCancelledAt":null,"executionTime":29,"lastExecutedAt":1749459967660,"lastExecutedByKernel":"66d47e83-130d-43c6-af5c-953d7c9ace2e","lastScheduledRunId":null,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Import necessary libraries\nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Load the data\nbusinesses = pd.read_csv(\"data/businesses.csv\")\nnew_businesses = pd.read_csv(\"data/new_businesses.csv\")\ncountries = pd.read_csv(\"data/countries.csv\")\ncategories = pd.read_csv(\"data/categories.csv\")"},"id":"113ca14a-42b7-4bee-bc8a-349e2b4368cf","cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"outputs":[]},{"source":"\n\n# What is the oldest business on every continent?\n\n# Start by merging the businesses and countries datasets into one\nbusinesses_countries = businesses.merge(countries, on=\"country_code\")\n\n# Create a new DataFrame that lists only the continent and oldest year_founded\ncontinent = businesses_countries.groupby(\"continent\").agg({\"year_founded\":\"min\"})\n\n# Merge this continent DataFrame with businesses_countries\nmerged_continent = continent.merge(businesses_countries, on=[\"continent\", \"year_founded\"])\n\n# Subset the continent DataFrame so that only the four columns of interest are included, saving it as oldest_business_continent\noldest_business_continent = merged_continent[[\"continent\", \"country\", \"business\", \"year_founded\"]]\n\n# View the result\nprint(oldest_business_continent)\n\n# How many countries per continent lack data on the oldest businesses? \n# Does including the `new_businesses` data change this?\n\n# Add the data in new_businesses to the existing businesses\nall_businesses = pd.concat([new_businesses, businesses])\n\n# Perform a new merge between the businesses and the countries data.
